# chime-fullstack-project backend

### Getting started

Requirements: Python 3 (pre-installed on recent Mac OS X), pip, [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)

1. From project root run `$ cd backend`
2. Run `$ python3 -m venv .` to create virtual environment
3. Run `$ source bin/activate` to activate virtual environment
4. Run `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` to install project dependencies
5. Run `$ python app.py` to start Flask server

If the installation was successful you should see no errors and should be able to access the server at `localhost:5000/api/example`.

We have included boilerplate code for an example [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) endpoint and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) model.
